## 💻 Code Overview

The app is written in **Kotlin** and leverages **Jetpack Compose for Desktop** for its UI. Here’s a breakdown of the key components:

### 1. **Data Model**
- Defines the structure of a note.
  ```kotlin
  data class Note(val title: String, val content: String)
  ```

### 2. **UI Components**
- Built with Compose functions for modularity.
  ```kotlin
  @Composable
  fun NoteList(notes: List<Note>, onNoteSelected: (Note) -> Unit) {
      // Displays the list of notes
  }
  ```

### 3. **State Management**
- Uses Compose’s reactive state for dynamic updates.
  ```kotlin
  var notes by remember { mutableStateOf(listOf<Note>()) }
  var selectedNote by remember { mutableStateOf<Note?>(null) }
  ```

### 4. **Data Persistence**
- Saves notes locally (e.g., to a JSON file).
  ```kotlin
  fun saveNotes(notes: List<Note>) {
      // Logic to write notes to a file
  }
  ```
